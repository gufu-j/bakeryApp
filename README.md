## How to use this app? 

This app is divided in three routes, Home, Cakes and Cart.
Home displays the name of the bakery, cakes lets the user to search a cake and cart keepsa list the cakes the client purchases. Using this app is very simple. Searching a cake requires the user to look for anything he/she wishes. For example, if user types strawbery, cake with this fruit will appear, either one or many. This depends on how many strawberry cakes the bakery has to display. The search app will look for a cake that matches what the user type.

The Cake route includes a list of cakes. User can scroll down and find the one he/she wants and order it. For addin a cake, simply write a name, add an image address and description. Then click on "Add cake " and this will add your cake to the list a the very end of the list of cakes. Whatever the cake user adds will be added with same picture size, font style, card style and button.

Once the user decides what to order, the Cart will make a list of all cakes that were ordered by the user.

To build this app, I first created a db.json file containing some data I used to start displaying some of it to the user. I did not use a Public API. This app was built with ReactJs. 

Hope this was helpful, and have a great day!
